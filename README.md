First python homework assignment to create a simple menu ordering system


## Welcome to the variety food truck!
This basic python ordering system provides a simple interface for allowing customers to order from a pre-determined dictionary menu.  

### Initial Menu Category Selections

Users are initially asked to select **by number** from a list menu item categories.  For example:

> From which menu would you like to order?  
> 1: Snacks  
> 2: Meals  
> 3: Drinks  
> 4: Dessert  

### Menu Category Item Selection

Successful selection of a menu category will provide the listing of menu items with pricing options for the user to select from.  For example if the **1: Meals** category was selected the user might see the following *example* options. 

>Item # | Item name        | Price  
>-------|------------------|-------  
>1      | Burrito          | $4.49  
>2      | Teriyaki Chicken | $9.99  
>3      | Sushi            | $7.49  
>4      | Pad Thai         | $6.99  
>5      | Pizza - Cheese   | $10.99
>6      | Pizza - Chicken  | $8.49  

As with menu category selection the user will be prompted to select their desired menu item by number.  Successful selection will prompt the user to enter the quantity desired for that menu item.
